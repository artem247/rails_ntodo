Hello, this is my test task approach.
App is deployed to Heroku â€” http://protected-stream-47706.herokuapp.com/
existing user: email: artem@artem2.com, password: password

Scope of work:
1. Working authentication system based on session cookies, no Devise or something similar.
2. Each user has his own set of todo lists and todo items
3. User can interact with todo's from different lists on the same page
4. There is unit and integration testing, using MiniTest, but not for the whole functionality.
5. I did redesign a UI, felt that it would benefit the end product.

What's left:
1. Proper Ajax or integration with SPA
2. Deadlines assignment for tasks
3. Drag'n'drop for priority
4. SQL task
